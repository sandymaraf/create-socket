# Introduction

This project creates a socket that allows communication between the client and the server.

## How to use it?

Inside the directory, you need to run the following command in a terminal :

    ./server.py

And keep this terminal open. Once done, open a new terminal and run the following command:

    ./client.py

I assume you used your local address for testing, type some message in the client terminal and see the same image in the server terminal, confirming that the connection was established without having to run any additional commands.
